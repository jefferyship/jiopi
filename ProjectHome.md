# Project Description #
Similar to OSGi, JIOPi is also a specification for building Java Module System .

JIOPi is the abbreviation of Java Interface-Oriented Programming initiative . Its mission is to create open specification for building a Java system which is composed of modules . The philosophy of JIOPi origin from industrialized system . A industrialized system is composed of several parts . And the blueprints described how to build a industrialized system by these parts . The same as industrialized system , Java system also can be described by blueprints . One can design a Java System by reusable modules whose are described by blueprints or specifications , and assemble them to build a new Java system by configuration files or programs .

The JIOPi specification delivers an open , common architecture for service providers , developers , software vendors to develop , deploy , manage and assemble modules in a coordinated fashion . It enables Java System to automatically update its modules, easily upgrade functions by replacing modules , automatically install new modules .

# Features #
  * **Lightweight** - only one small Jar file  (less than 50k) needs to be added to the classpath
  * **High compatibility** - can be used in any Java project(J2SE,J2EE), or even an OSGi project
  * **Good integration** - can be integrated with nearly all mainstream Frameworks (Struts,Spring,Hibernate etc.. )
  * **POJO compatibility** - JIOPi Module is fully compatible with POJO Jar. It can be used in any other Java System without any modifications
  * **None API Intrusive** - Get JIOPi Module without Use JIOPi API, POJO ONLY!
  * **Separate runtime environment** - resolve dependency conflicts
  * **Plain old method calling** - so there is no runtime overhead
  * **IoC style dependencies** - easier to understand and use
  * **Ignore the implementation details** - call the APIs to access specified module directly
  * **Assembly mode** - a Module can be assembled by a assembly file
  * **Replaceable assembly** - use a module by provide a new assembly file
  * **Smart upgrade** - automatic upgrade module program to the latest compatible version , or you can specify a fixed version for stability
